# 🏠 House Price Prediction with Regression 📈

A **machine learning regression project** that predicts real estate prices based on essential housing features. Using Python and scikit-learn, this project showcases a real-world application of predictive modeling using clean, visual, and insightful methods.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

Predict the **final sale price of a house** based on various parameters like:

- 📐 **Living area**
- 🚿 **Bathrooms**
- 🛏️ **Bedrooms**
- 🏗️ **Year Built**
- 🚪 **Garage Area**
- 🧱 **Overall Quality**
- 🪵 **Basement Size**
- 🔥 **Fireplaces**

The model is trained and tested to make accurate predictions using a **linear regression** approach.

## 🧠 Motivation

> With real estate markets becoming more data-driven, **predictive analytics** can help buyers, sellers, agents, and developers make **informed decisions**. This project explores how machine learning models can:

- Provide **fair price estimates**
- Reduce human error and bias
- Guide **urban planning & financial assessment**
- Support **automated valuation systems (AVMs)**

## ⚙️ Model Pipeline

🔽 **1. Data Preprocessing**  
- Drop null values and handle outliers  
- Convert categorical data (if needed)  
- Normalize and structure the input

🔬 **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Identify trends and correlations  
- Visuals created:  
  - Price vs. Area  
  - Garage Area, Year Built, Quality  
  - Distribution of key features  

📌 **3. Feature Engineering**  
Selected strong predictors based on correlation with price.

🎓 **4. Model Building**  
- Linear Regression trained on selected features  
- Predictions made on test dataset  
- Evaluated using **R² score**

📉 **5. Evaluation**  
- Plotted `Actual vs Predicted` graph  
- Analyzed residuals for errors  
- Achieved a good test score (~R² close to 1)
